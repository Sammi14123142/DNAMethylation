Take the human genome package BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 for example. This package contains the entire genome sequences for human provided by University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
chr22 = Hsapiens[["chr22"]]
s = subseq(chr22,start=23456789,width=1000)
print( as.character(s) )
```

What is the GC-content of s?

```{r}
sum(alphabetFrequency(s)[c("C","G")])/1000
letterFrequency(s,"CG",as.prob=TRUE)
```

How many CpGs and GpCs in s respectively?

```{r}
countPattern("CG",s)
countPattern("GC",s)
```
